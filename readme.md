# Random Password Generator

## This application will retrieve input from the user to generate a random password using HTML, CSS, and Javascript:

 * ### The user will be prompted to provide their desired character length. If it is less than 8, or more than 128, they will receive a notification that their input is insufficient, and to try again.
 * ### The user will be given the option to select upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters as the criteria to compose their password. If they do not choose any of these options they will receive a notification that they must select at least one character type, and to try again. 
 * ### Contactonated arrays, for loops, listener events, and functions were used in order to achieve the desired functionality.
